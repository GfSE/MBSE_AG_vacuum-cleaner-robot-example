* Usages (e.g., part, interface, state, ...): Camel Case with lower-case first letter
  * Example: part myVehicle : VehicleDefinition {...}

  * Example: package vehicle_components  {...}
  * Avoid notation with blanks

* Artifact name: 
  * To discuss

* Imports: Use private imports per default

* Overall artifact organization:
